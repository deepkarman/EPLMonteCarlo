To run:
type "python teams.py" in the command line.

Change num_iter in line 8 of teams.py to change the number of iterations the program runs for. 
We do not save the entire league table in each iteration to save space, but we could for a more detailed analysis.
Right now code is configured to get parameters from both season's data. We ('I') can change this manually.
Data for the seasons is in the two CSV files, upto date as on 6th May 2019.
The outputs I got are recorded in the two "op.txt" files.
parameters.py was a testing file, does not need to be run.
